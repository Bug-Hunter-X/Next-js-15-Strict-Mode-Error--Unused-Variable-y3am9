# Next.js 15 Strict Mode Error: Unused Variable

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15's strict mode: using an unused variable.  Strict mode enforces a higher standard for code quality, and this example shows how an seemingly harmless unused variable can cause an error.

## The Bug

The `about.js` file contains a simple component.  However, the variable `a` is declared but never used. In Next.js 15's strict mode, this will cause an error during compilation or runtime.

## The Solution

The solution is to either use the variable or remove it entirely.  The `aboutSolution.js` demonstrates the corrected code, removing the unused variable `a`.

## How to reproduce the issue

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
3. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
4. Run `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`)
5. Navigate to `/about`. You will see the error in development mode. (in production you might not see the error)

## How to fix

1.  Remove unused variables to eliminate the error or utilize the variable in the code if it is actually necessary. 

This example highlights the importance of clean code practices and how strict mode helps catch potential issues early in development.
